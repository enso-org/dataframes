// TLDR: If .cpp file uses numpy it must contain this macro.
//
// NOTE: [MWU]
// NumPy uses not entirely fortunate approach that upon initialization call
// a `PyArray_API` variable is set. However the variable is declared as static
// in the header -- so every compilation unit including NumPy gets its own copy
// of `PyArray_API`. And every single copy needs to be initialized.
//
// NumPy provides a few macros that allow controlling the behavior to some
// degree. While it may be enough for projects consisting of multiple 
// compilation units in a single assembly, I don't think it is possible to get
// this working with our project layout that spans across several shared 
// libraries. (PyArray_API would have been needed to be marked with dllimport)
//
// Perhaps someone smarter (or with more time to spend on this) can devise a 
// solution that works on all 3 supported platforms and is not as ugly as this
// macro-based workaround.
